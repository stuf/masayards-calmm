Attempt at creating a sane(r) Kancolle viewer client by using [Calmm](https://github.com/calmm-js/documentation).

## Known issues

 * **OSX** - placing the main window in a screen with a different pixel density may cause blurriness in the game.

## Acknowledgements

 * Thanks to chentsulin's excellent [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) for a nice base to build an Electron application on.
